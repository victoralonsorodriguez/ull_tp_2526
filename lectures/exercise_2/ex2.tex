  \textbf{Exercise:} Multithreaded and distributed Barnes-Hut algorigthm n-body simulation.
  \begin{itemize}
   \item See TAP p. 37-47, p. 74-85, and p. 139-154
  \end{itemize}


  \textbf{To do}
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item Create makefile for the project.
   \item Separate the main program into its own program source code file.
   \item Separate the Barnes-Hut algorigthm into its own module.
   \item Modify the code to use the types and routines in the geometry and particle modules.
   \item Modify the program to write the simulation data into a file “output.dat”, where each line contains the simulation state as ``time p1x p1y p1z p2x p2y p2z ... pnx pny pnz''.
   \item Parallelise the code using OpenMP making sure that the code can be compiled with and without OpenMP support.
   \item Write a separate distributed version of the code using MPI.
   \item Describe how the code works (in general) in the readme.md file.
   \item Compare the execution times of the serial, parallel, and distributed Barnes-Hut simulation for a set of particle setups.
  \end{enumerate}
